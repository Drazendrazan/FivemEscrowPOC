## ‚ùó Info
ITS AN FIVEM ESCROW DUMPER THAT RETURNS BYTECODE! 

## üß† For Retardos
PASSWORD IS: **egg**
Heres an [already finished build for FiveM](https://workupload.com/file/yrBfkx3bnLv) just replace this with your server Folder.
The resource name of the resource you want to dump MUST be: **dumpresource**
AND if you need to dump client files just edit the fxmanifest from client_script to server_script(ONLY ONE SERVER_SCRIPT PER RESTART! DELETE OTHER SERVER_SCRIPT ENTRIES)

## ‚ùìUsage
Setup an normal [custom FiveM server build](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/blob/master/docs/building.md) and edit the citizen-scripting-lua.cpp in \fivem\code\components\citizen-scripting-lua\src\. Add the code from POC.cpp in "LoadFileInternal" and the 2 Functions anywhere above it.

After that just build it and go to \fivem\code\bin\server\windows\release\
there just add svadhesive.dll from the [latest FiveM build](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) and add "svadhesive", to components.json in the same Path.
